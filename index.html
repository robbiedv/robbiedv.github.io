                    <p>head on over to codepen and check out this guy and make something cool with it. if you're above that, let a kid goof around with it for a minute and see what they come up with. this was the final
                    project for the 'scholorship challenge course' sponsored by google. we were given starter html and css (which i tweaked of course), but all javascript was written by myself.</p>
