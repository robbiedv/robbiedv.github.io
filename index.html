				<p>head on over to codepen and check out this guy and make something cool with it. if you're above that, let a kid goof around with it for a minute and see what they come up with. this was the final
          project for the 'scholarship challenge course' sponsored by google. we were given starter html and css (which i tweaked of course), but all javascript was written by myself.

        <p>pure html and css 'animal trading cards' created in the beginning stages of the gro with google course. lots of boxes inside boxes here. while 
          building these i kept finding myself distracted from the coding to do more research on the featured animal. take a look at the design and code behind these at codepen.

        <p>this memory game was made with pure javascript. it was a pretty fun project, but i'd be less than honest if i said it didn't make me want to chuck my computer out the window a couple of times. special acknowledgments to my younger brother for helping me debug the game, i think he enjoyed breaking it a few times. try your hand at the game and see if you can get a rating of four stars
